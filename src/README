Status of code before driving to melbourne tomorrow.


Remember you need the following to run to get any sound coming out,
soundplay_node.py talks to the sound driver/card.

rosrun sound_play soundplay_node.py 


cls; ./simplePub
cls; ./simpleSub


This produces the following output:

There appears to be a problem  with changing voices on the sound card.
Which  can be  somewhat reproduced  with the  following  two commands.
Looking at say.py  code gives no clues I can  tell. So essentially, if
you don't leave  a big enough gap between command 1)  and 2) below the
voice does  not change.  The same  appears to be happening  in my code
but there  sleeping for  5 or  10 seconds does  not help.   So perhaps
there is some command to be issued to the soundcard/sound_play_node.py
to get the sound card to accept a new voice.

1) rosrun sound_play say.py "hello world" voice_kal_diphone
2) rosrun sound_play say.py "hello world" voice_nitech_us_slt_arctic_hts
